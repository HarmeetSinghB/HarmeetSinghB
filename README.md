👋 Hey there! I'm Harmeet Singh, a passionate problem solver with a knack for numbers and a love for code. 🧮💻 Originally from India 🇮🇳, I'm currently immersing myself in the world of Business Analysis as a post-grad student in Canada 🍁.

🎓 With a Bachelor's in Science: Mathematics and a stack of certifications in C++, SQL Server, Advanced Excel, and MS-Office, I bring a diverse skill set to the table. Whether it's crunching data or crafting elegant solutions, I thrive on challenges that require both analytical thinking and creative problem-solving.

💼 When I'm not diving into data or coding up a storm, you can find me honing my skills in business analysis tools, connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts on GitHub, or exploring the great outdoors 🌲.

🌟 Let's connect, collaborate, and code our way to success! Feel free to reach out—I'm always up for an adventure in tech or a good cup of chai! ☕️
